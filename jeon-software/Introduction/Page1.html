            The experiment consists of two parts and a survey.
            You will earn an additional amount based on decisions that you and other participants make.
            At the end of the experiment, you will randomly select one part,
            and earnings from that part will be used to calculate your final earnings.
            Your final earnings will be paid to you in cash in private at the end of the experiment.
